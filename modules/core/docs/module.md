# Core

Core provides dependency-light process, memory, error, hashing, generic data primitives, and bounded task execution. Public data utilities include strongly tagged monotonic versions, generational slot maps, sparse-to-dense handle storage, merged dirty ranges, and bounded dirty bitsets. Task APIs retain the `<woki/task.hpp>` include and `woki::task` namespace.

Core data headers do not depend on graphics, assets, RHI, or math. Domain modules own policy and state while delegating generic identity, storage, and change tracking to these primitives.

# Task API

`woki::task` owns bounded execution and completion state. `Scheduler` is a fixed-size CPU pool for short, finite compute work. Jobs submitted to it must not perform implicit blocking file, network, process, or device I/O; use the separately owned `IoExecutor` for blocking work. Neither executor is a global service. Owners must keep an executor alive until submissions and continuations using it have completed.

Submission is nonblocking. A full queue returns `QueueFull`, and any submission after stop returns `ExecutorStopped`. `RequestStop` rejects queued future work, lets currently running work finish cooperatively, and is idempotent. Destruction requests stop and joins native workers; joining from a worker never self-deadlocks. Job exceptions are contained at worker boundaries and future-producing APIs translate exceptions to `UnknownError`.

`Future<T>` has thread-safe shared, single-assignment completion state. `IsReady` never blocks. Native `Wait` is the explicit blocking boundary; Emscripten `Wait` reports `InvalidState` for incomplete work so the browser thread cannot deadlock. `Then` only registers work and schedules it on the supplied executor after completion. Completion callbacks and rejection handlers never run while future or queue locks are held. Values used by `Wait` and `WhenAll` are copyable; `void` has a dedicated path.

`CompletionQueue` is the bounded publication executor for a main or render thread. Producers may submit from any thread, but its owner calls `Drain(limit)` on the publication thread. Stopping rejects undrained work. Cancellation is cooperative: tokens are safe to copy across threads, while callables decide their own cancellation granularity. `ParallelFor` checks between chunks and uses a bounded number of chunk workers rather than one queued job per element. `WhenAll` uses completion callbacks and never blocks a worker on a child future.

On Emscripten, `Scheduler` and `IoExecutor` are explicit inline cooperative executors and require no pthread support. Submission, cancellation, errors, and continuations retain the same ordering contract, but CPU parallelism and blocking I/O isolation are unavailable; browser integrations should use asynchronous platform APIs and publish through `CompletionQueue`.

Queues and future state are safe for concurrent producers. A `Future` owns its completion state independently of the originating job, but continuations retain a non-owning executor reference until the parent completes. Profile queue-full counts, queue-to-start latency, task duration, chunk size, cancellation latency, and completion-drain budgets at the call sites where workload names and frame context are available; the module intentionally has no global profiler or backend scheduler dependency.
